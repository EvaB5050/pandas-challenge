### Data Bootcamp Module 4 Challenge

## REPORT

The school analysis shows that the variation in results based on School Size is not significant.
Students in Smaller Schools (<1000 students) did perform slightly better in % OVERALL PASSING maths and reading 
than Medium Schools (1000-2000 students) or Large (2000-5000 students) Schools. 79% for Small, 78% for Medium vs 70% for Large Schools.

To maximise students' performance relative to costs of providing more schools and teachers to accomodate fewer students, 
the most favourable outcome seems to favour Medium sized schools (1000-2000 students).

Comparing Government with Independent Schools' % OVERALL PASSING in maths and reading shows that students in
Independent Schools performed better, 77% compared with 71% in Government Schools.
Further analysis would be required to determine whether this is due to school practices, smaller student numbers per school
or smaller class sizes.
